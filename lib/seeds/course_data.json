{"name":"Village Greens","rating":4.0,"city":"Greenwood Village","state":"CO","description":"18 hole with concrete tees, cairns mark tees.  Mostly flat course with minimal elevation change throughout. Little to no obstacles currently but once vegetation matures that will likely change. Holes 14 and 15 play around and over the only true obstacles onsite, a wooded creek area. The course features four par 4 holes to play, making for better scoring per round. The open area which house the course shares space with a mountain bike trail with man made obstacles, the bike trail is out of the way and should be easily avoided. Overall this is a good clean course, it is well maintained by the city and the \"locals\" are friendly. This is not however a difficult course and lacks any real technical challenge. Making it perfect for beginners or as a solid practice play.

The $30,000 circuit was funded in part by a $15,000 joint venture grant from Jefferson County. Similar to regular golf, disc golf, also known as Frisbee golf, has been around since the 1970s. The game involves throwing a disk or Frisbee at a basket, trying to land your disc in the basket in the fewest number of throws. Each basket, or hole, is assigned a par value like traditional golf.\n\nThe city contracted with Denver-based BADCO Disc Golf Club for design of the course, which begins near the City Park Lake, passes the soccer and softball fields and runs along Big Dry Creek.
